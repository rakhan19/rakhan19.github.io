								<h2>Education</h2>
								<p>Even though I switched out of the pre-medicine track, I still have the drive to help others. I have started pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science where I will learn more about data structures, algorithms, and all the tools necessary to succeed as a software engineer. However, I will continue to remember the skills I learned from my pursuits in Neuroscience and Public Health. </p>
								<p>Public Health has taught me to look into both upstream and downstream issues that allow me to assess the root of the problem at hand. This skill will be translated in the software industry; for example, I will be mindful of how a single line of code could affect the rest of the system. Therefore, I aim to write intentional and good code. Additionally, Public Health has taught me about cultural competence, so I could deliver solutions to multiple demographics while keeping the intended audience in mind. This will apply in the software industry by ensuring my colleagues will be able to understand my code without having to exert extreme effort.</p>
								<h2>Experiences</h2>
								<p>As a Resident Assistant in Gold Hall at UAB, I maintained the wellbeing of my community. I prepared multiple programs for residents, including virtual game nights, involvement workshops, and study groups. Additionally, I resolved floor issues, including sanitation problems and noise complaints. I also performed additional duties including taking calls, managing the front desk, and working the package room.</p>
								<p>As an AmeriCorps Summer VISTA at Blazer Kitchen, I managed the food bank inventory and helped implement the Halal chicken initiative. I also prepared recruitment materials for social media, registered new shoppers, and assisted shoppers with checkout.</p>
								<h3>Leadership</h3>
								<p>Over the past few years, I have served as the president of the UAB Ambassadors, the director of funding for Student Government, a senator for the College of Arts and Sciences, and as the treasurer of the Muslim Students' Association.</p>
								<h4>Hobbies</h4>
								<p>During my free time, I enjoy working on my car and listening to podcasts. I also love watching movies and reading up on the latest news. Mental and physical health is important, so I also exercise in my free time.</p>
