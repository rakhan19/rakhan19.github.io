											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, I was contantly surrounded by the medical hustle of the city. I knew I wanted to help people, so I decided to pursue the medical track in college. Therefore, I took all of the pre-medicine courses and excelled in them, but I was missing the passion. <br> <br> Ever since I was a child, I was fascinated by technology. So, I decided to take a step back and realized that I did not have to become a doctor to help society. After understanding what I wanted to do in life, I arrived at two choices. I could continue medicine while being unhappy, or I could be brave and start over. One year ago, I decided to take the jump and pursue <b>computer science</b>.</p>
